# Pump failure Prediction


## Data

We have 1000 data points, cotains 2 classes like failure and non-failure classes. Each data point is collected at 1 Hr intervel, 

As per our analysis, 
- No Missing values
- Data is Highly imbalanced with More that 95% non failure and remaining failure cases
- pressure, flow rate Level and Failure: Shows a moderate positive correlation, indicating that higher pressure levels may lead to pump failure.
